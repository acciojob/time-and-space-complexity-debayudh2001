	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how an algorithm's runtime or resource usage grows as the input size increases. It's expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(nÂ²)) and helps developers compare algorithms' efficiency regardless of hardware. For example, a linear search (O(n)) checking each element once is less efficient than a binary search (O(log n)) which eliminates half the possibilities each step when searching a sorted list.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> measures how much memory an algorithm requires relative to its input size, also expressed in Big O notation. It includes both auxiliary space (temporary space used during execution) and input space. For instance, an in-place sorting algorithm like bubble sort has O(1) space complexity as it only needs a constant amount of extra memory, while merge sort requires O(n) extra space to store temporary arrays during sorting.</p>
